- data post-processing
    - var/text/nums
        - for terminal var/text nodes, insert special token, and then create children with GPT tokenizer
        - for non-terminal var/text nodes, if assuming function, insert special function token,
            then assign name child (with GPT token children) as first child, then actual children as subsequent children
        - for nums, insert special num token, then tokenize each character to build child set
        - get rid of "normal-" prefix
    - (future) tree rebalancing
        - for all, make sure we have a fallback for unhandled cases (especially if we need to process syntactically incorrect sequences)
        - "+" type operators - replace "+" and sub/sup child with left grandchild and rebalance children
        - "E" type cases - possibly insert function nodes
- model
    - var/text/num
        - for special token, next token must be of corresponding type
        - for children of special var/text token, predict token from text vocab, and restrict type to text and end
        - for children of special num token, restrict type to num vocab
    - (future) enforce syntactic correctness
        - ensure matrix children are always matrix rows, and that number of children is correct
- generation
    - make adjustments for var/text/num sub-trees
    - nucleus sampling
    - beam search
